## Project Overview

This repository contains our implementation for efficient fine-tuning of RoBERTa using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for the AG News text classification task. The project was developed as part of the Deep Learning course (Spring 2025).

### Key Features

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA adapters
- RoBERTa-base as the foundation model
- Text classification for AG News dataset (4 categories)
- Under 1 million trainable parameters
- 94.59% test accuracy

## Dataset

The AG News dataset consists of approximately 120,000 news articles categorized into four classes:
- World
- Sports
- Business
- Sci/Tech

## Implementation Details

We fine-tuned the RoBERTa-base model using LoRA with the following configuration:
- Rank (r): 6
- Alpha (Î±): 24
- LoRA dropout: 0.1
- Target modules: query, key, and value matrices in attention layers
- Trainable parameters: 925,444 (0.737% of total)

## Results

- Training accuracy: 94.85%
- Validation accuracy: 94.10%
- Test accuracy: 94.59%
- F1 scores per class:
  - World: 0.95
  - Sports: 0.99
  - Business: 0.92
  - Sci/Tech: 0.92
- Kaggle competition scores:
  - Public leaderboard: 0.84625
  - Private leaderboard: 0.84900
